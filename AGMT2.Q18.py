#What is tuple? Difference between list and tuple.

'''A tuple is a sequence of immutable Python objects.
Tuples are sequences, just like lists.  
The differences between tuples and lists are, the tuples cannot be changed 
unlike lists and tuples use parentheses, whereas lists use square brackets. 
Eg fruits=(“Mango”,”Banana”,”Oranges”,23,44) 
Eg numbers=(11,22,33,44)  
Eg fruits=”Mango”,”Banana”,”Oranges”annot be changed after the execution of the tuple.
